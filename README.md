# python-nlp-dev-container

This project aims to build and make available simple docker container image 
for developing python based NLP projects. Keeping in mind how developers use 
different development workflows to train, finetune or develop in our cluster, this image can be adjusted with runtime variables to deploy a container with support for - (1) Jupyter Lab, (2) SSH + Visual Studio Code and (3) Python 
script as Kubernetes Jobs workflows.
